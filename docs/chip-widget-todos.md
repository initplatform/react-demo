# Chip Widget TODOs

- [x] Allow Keyboard navigation of column values
- [ ] Set value if user types complete column name and only 1 option left (no click required)
- [ ] Add fuzzy select to column input
- [ ] Should user be able to select same column more than once? (yes...)
- [ ] When too many chips, how to handle overflow?
- [x] Escape should clear out input while typing or tabbing
